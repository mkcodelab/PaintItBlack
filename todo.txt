add some weird tools like animated tools:

select rain, click, droplets fell from top of canvas, and it will stain it with color etc.

whole canvas should be animated in requestAnimationFrame

_done_
add layersService which will be holding layer stack for all backgrounds, added drawings etc.
it has to keep it in array

add showcase canvas layer on which we will paint "animated" things like "drawed" square or ellipse etc.

add opacity of pencil, just add rgba conversion from hex value, and set alpha to the value from range input

add merge layers functionality for layers.service
mergeLayers(layer1, layer2) {
get image data from layer1 and layer2
delete layer1 and 2
this . _layers.splice()
then create new context
then add new layer with initialized context
then putImageData from layer1 and layer2
}

saving image: create new context, draw imageData from all layers context consecutively,
 save as png


add invert color pencil
